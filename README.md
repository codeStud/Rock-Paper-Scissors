# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Author: Pratik Raj

One of the most fun games you can play right now!
This is a game which I developed using HTML5/CSS3/Flexbox and
JavaScript.

You need to play the game of Rock Paper Scissors
in a 1-to-1 match against the computer.

There will be a 5 game series. Whoever wins the most rounds,
wins the entire game. (There is a possibility of tie as well!)

All the best!!
